    Events -> All -> {Drill Name} -> Join Event -> Enter Event Password (It will be provided)

After that, team members can join the event through the same buttonology.

    Events -> All -> {Drill Name} -> Start

## Tools

### Main Tools

- Arkime
- ELK Stack
- Wazuh
- Velociraptor (Very few questions will require Velociraptor)
- IDA Free
- Detect It Easy
- PeStudio
- Ghidra

They will provide a designated VM for malware analysis (so you don't risk infecting your own machine).

## High Level Skills

They mentioned that the challenges will involve the following skills.

- Incident Response
- Threat Hunting
- Malware Analysis/Reverse Engineering (malware)

## Tasks

It looks like the Tasks (questions) will be broken up into categories based on the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC).

### CKC

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command and Control
7. Actions on Objectives

## Strategy

Because tasks don't need to be answered in order, we can delegate them based on team member's skill sets.

Connections to the VM's are shared amongst teams. So logging into an RDP session with the same user that another team member is using will log the team member out.

This makes it all the more important that tasks are delegated based on skills and the tools necessary to carry out the tasks. Good communication will also be important to ensure nobody kicks anybody off a VM in the middle of completing a task.
